The code search all possible translated networks but it may not search all possible factorizations $\kappa_k, \theta(\mathbf{n})$ and $\omega(\mathbf{n})$ because determining the constant $\kappa_k$ is not trivial problem. Nevertheless, the authors believe that the current choice of the constant $\kappa_k$ in the code provides all possible factorizations and we are aiming to prove this statement as future works.
